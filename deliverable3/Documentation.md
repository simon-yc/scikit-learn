## (#24037) RandomForestClassifier class_weight/max_samples interaction can lead to ungraceful and nondescriptive failure

</br>

###  **Find cause of bug**

The root cause of this issue is that the `n_samples_bootstrap` variable is being set to 0 when it is expected to be >= 1. The variable is initialized in the `fit()` method on line 403 in `_forest.py` where it is set to the return value of the function `_get_n_samples_bootstrap` which takes in the `max_samples` value as input as well as the `n_samples` value. Inside the `_get_n_samples_bootstrap` function, we enter the third if statement (line 119 in _forest.py) where we return the result of `round(n_samples * max_samples)`. The result of the round is 0 because the product of `n_samples` and `max_samples` is too small (rounds to 0). This is where our issue comes from as `n_samples_bootstrap` is now set to 0. Later on, in line 473 in `_forest.py`, in the Parallel loop we call the function `_parallel_build_trees` where we are using `n_samples_bootstrap` to generate our indices array (line 171 in `_forest.py`). Since our `n_samples_bootstrap` is set to 0, `_generate_sample_indices` returns an empty list, which causes the crash in `compute_class_weight` on line 182 in `_forest.py`.

###  **Find possible fixes for bug**

We have three possible fixes for this issue:

1. The first fix that comes to mind is to change the `_get_n_samples_bootstrap` function to return 1 instead of 0 when the product of n_samples and max_samples is too small. This would fix the issue since the initial problem was that the `_get_n_samples_bootstrap` function returns `round(n_samples * max_samples)`, but since the value of max_samples is too small, it results in a 0 rather than a non-zero integer. However, this approach would also change the behavior of the function. 

2. The second fix is to change the `_compute_class_weight` function to handle the case where the input array is empty. This would fix the issue since the initial problem was that the `_compute_class_weight` function was being called with an empty array, which was a result of calling the `_generate_sample_indices` function that takes in the `n_samples_bootstrap` variable created by the `_get_n_samples_bootstrap` function, which we know returns an unwanted 0. However, this approach would also change the behavior of the function.

2. The third fix is to change the `_get_n_samples_bootstrap` function to throw a value error when the product of n_samples and max_samples is too small. This would fix the issue since the initial problem was that the `_get_n_samples_bootstrap` function returns `round(n_samples * max_samples)`, but since the value of max_samples is too small, it results in a 0 rather than a non-zero integer. This approach does not change the behavior of the function, but it does change the behavior of the `fit()` method in `_forest.py` since it would now throw an error instead of continuing on with the rest of the code.
